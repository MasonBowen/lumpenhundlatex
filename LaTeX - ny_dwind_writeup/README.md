# dWind-NY
GitRepos for relevant data and code for estimating the value of distributed (BTM+FTM) wind versus utility-scale wind

## Draft Paper Outline
- Intro
	- DW general discussion
		- define DW, FOM, BTM, utility-scale, etc
		- discussion on key differences between BTM vs FOM vs utility
		- possibility to interconnect DW
		- current market for DW in NY, nationally
	- Adoption fundamentals
		- why is it important to talk about DW?
	- NY-specific wind environment (why did we pick NY?)
		- current state
		- potential
		- policies in place (e.g., incentives?)
	- VDER
		- discussion on values
		- price signals as coordinator (i.e., why did they transition from NEM?)
			- granular vs non-granular compensation mechanisms

- Meth.
	- Siting
	- Sizing
	- Discussion of parcel dataset
	- Detailed VDER discussion (i.e., actual values, methodology for calculating values)
	- Costs
	- BTM vs FOM vs utility-scale applications
		- including discussion on how values/costs are calculated in each application
	- sensitivities and how they're implemented? if we add them at some point

- Results/Discussion
	- "siloed" results (BTM value/cost in a vacuum, FOM value/cost in a vacuum, etc.)
	- cross-size comparisons (results after evaluating all three applications simultaneously, for same parecel)
	- what are the factors that drive value for FOM? parcel characteristics that show up most?
	
	- scenario analysis? playing around with some VDER inputs, other variables as sensitivities
		- NEM vs VDER for BTM compensation?
	- look at PCM results in 2030, see how E&C values might change
